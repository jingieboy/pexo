Hipparcos astrometry computed via the hipAstrometry Java application.
Each file contains observations of a HIP star, with its HIP number if the file name

Columns:
t: float year

obsX obsY: RA, Dec

barStartX barStartY barEndX barEndY: X and Y position of the error bar edges.
From the documentation: "Each straight line indicates the observed po-sition of the star at a particular epoch: because themeasurement is one-dimensional, the precise locationalong this position line is undetermined by the observation."

The field Consortium has the following meaning:
F:data from FAST;
f:data from FAST rejected in constructing the published astrometric solution;
N:data from NDAC;
n:data from NDAC rejected in constructing the published astrometric solution.
