# PEXO: a package for Precision EXOplanetology [Emulation only]

### The package is used to model relativistic timing, astrometry and radial velocity

Compared with previous models and packages, PEXO is general enough to account for binary motion and stellar reflex motions induced by planetary companions. PEXO is precise enough to treat various relativistic effects both in the Solar System and in the target system (Roemer, Shapiro, and Einstein delays).

PEXO is able to model timing to a precision of 1 ns, astrometry to a precision of 1 microarcsecond, and radial velocity to a precision of 1 $\mu$m/s. The relevant paper will be published by ApJS, please cite the paper if you use PEXO in your work.
